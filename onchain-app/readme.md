## **Part 2: Technical Guide and Deployment Guide**

### **Technical Overview**

The **BaseScamRegistry** smart contract is designed with the following core components:

1. **Reporting System**:
   - Submit reports with reasons and timestamps.
   - Reports are voted on to escalate critical scams.

2. **Reputation Management**:
   - Users earn or lose reputation points based on their actions, such as reporting scams or submitting false reports.

3. **Token Details**:
   - Verified token owners can add their contact info, audit certificates, and contract type (e.g., ERC-20, ERC-721).

4. **Review System**:
   - Users submit reviews for tokens. Incentivized reviews are hidden until they reach a threshold of upvotes.

5. **Insurance Pool**:
   - A decentralized fund allows users to claim compensation for verified scam losses.

6. **Faucet**:
   - Users can claim 500 `BSCAM` tokens every 30 days for free.

7. **Admin Controls**:
   - Manage insurance claims, verify token details, and update administrative privileges.
